Constants are a way to send values to MCP servers. These values are typically sensitive information such as API keys, authentication tokens, or other configuration parameters that should not be exposed to the LLM.

## Passing Constants to the Client

When initializing the mcplug client, you can provide constants as part of the configuration:

```ts
import { mcplug } from "@mcplug/client";

const tools = await mcplug(MCPLUG_TOKEN, {
  id: "plug_id",
  constants: {
    WEATHER_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here",
    AUTH_TOKEN: "your-auth-token"
  }
});
```

## How Constants Work

Constants are identified by an underscore prefix (`_`) in the tool's input schema on the server side. When you provide these constants during client initialization, they are automatically passed to the corresponding tools when the tools are called.

The LLM will not have access to these constants, making this approach secure for handling sensitive information.

## Example

Let's say you want to use a weather MCP server that needs a paid API key to get the weather in a specific city.

The developer of the MCP server has created a tool called `getWeather` that takes a city name as an argument and also the `WEATHER_API_KEY` constant.

It is your responsibility to provide the `WEATHER_API_KEY` constant.

```ts
const tools = await mcplug(MCPLUG_TOKEN, {
  id: "plug_id",
  constants: { WEATHER_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here" }
});

await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: "What is the weather in Tokyo?"
  tools,
});
```

## Another example

Let's say you want to use a Gmail tool.

It is your responsibility to provide all the necessary credentials to use the Gmail tool.

Mcplug does not provide a way to generate these credentials. You will need to build your own OAuth2.0 client ID and client secret and store them in your database.

Then you will need to store the refresh token in your database as well.

Once you have the client ID, client secret and refresh token, you can pass them to the client as constants.

```ts
const tools = await mcplug(MCPLUG_TOKEN, {
  id: "plug_id",
  constants: {
    GMAIL_CLIENT_ID: "your-client-id-here",
    GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET: "your-client-secret-here",
    GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN: "your-refresh-token-here"
  }
});
```
