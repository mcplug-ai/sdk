  For tools that you want to use across all projects, create a \~/.cursor/mcp.json file in your home directory. This
  makes MCP servers available in all your Cursor workspaces.
</Card>
<Card title="Project configuration" icon="folder-tree" horizontal>
  For tools specific to a project, create a .cursor/mcp.json file in your project directory. This allows you to define
  MCP servers that are only available within that specific project.
</Card>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcplug": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mcplug/client@latest", "YOUR_PLUG_ID"],
      "env": {
        "MCPLUG_TOKEN": "YOUR_MCPLUG_TOKEN"
        // any other constants needed by the MCP servers you are using
      }
    }
  }
}
```
