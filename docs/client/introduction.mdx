## What is the MCPlug client?

The MCPlug client is not a MCP client per se. It's a bridge that connects your application to your MCPlug server collection, enabling access to the tools, prompts, and resources you've configured.

It is not designed for direct use by AI applications like Claude Desktop.

Rather, it's a solution for developers building AI applications who want to integrate the MCPlug server collection into their products. With just a few lines of code, developers can give their AI applications access to all the tools, prompts, and resources available in their MCPlug environment.

## How does it work?

The MCPlug client communicates with our proxy server using the ID of the plug you've created in MCPlug.
It then generates a set of tools that your AI can leverage directly.
