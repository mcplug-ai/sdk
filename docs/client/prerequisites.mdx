## Creating a plug

To use the mcplug client, you need to have a PLUG_TOKEN.

A plug is a collection of mcp servers. You can manage your plugs on the [mcplug dashboard](https://mcplug.com/dashboard).

Grab the TOKEN of your plug on the page of your plug.

## Getting started

The mcplug client is a npm package that you can install in your application. First you need to install the package in your application.

```bash
npm install @mcplug/client
```

### Initialize the client

```ts
import { mcplug } from "@mcplug/client";

const tools = await mcplug({
  token: PLUG_TOKEN,
  id: "plug_id"
});
```

### Integrations

<Note>mcplug only works with Vercel AI SDK for now. So you need to use the Vercel AI SDK to use the tools.</Note>
