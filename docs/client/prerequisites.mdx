Before you can use mcplug, you need to create a plug and get a MCPlug token.

## Creating a plug

A plug is a collection of MCP servers you can create [here](https://mcplug.ai/dashboard/plugs).

First [browse](https://mcplug.ai/browse) and find MCP servers that you want to use. Then add it to your plug.

## MCPlug Token

In order to use the mcplug client, you need to have a MCPlug token.

You can get a MCPlug token from the [mcplug dashboard](https://mcplug.ai/settings/security/api-tokens).
