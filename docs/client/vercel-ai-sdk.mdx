MCPlug only works with Vercel AI SDK for now. So you need to use the Vercel AI SDK to use the tools.

The integration is very straightforward. Just use the ai sdk as usual but pass the tools of mcplug to it.

```ts
import { generateText, tool } from "ai";
import { mcplug } from "@mcplug/client";

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  //   this single line is enough to give your llm access to the tools of mcplug
  tools: await mcplug({
    token: PLUG_TOKEN,
    id: "plug_id"
  }),
  // This will insure the LLM can go back and forth between the tools and the prompt
  maxSteps: 10,
  prompt: "What is the weather in San Francisco?"
});
```
