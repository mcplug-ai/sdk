You can generate types for the plug tools by using the cli.

```bash
npx mcplug types <PLUG_ID>
```

This will generate a `<PLUG_NAME>.d.ts` file in the src or root directory of your project.

You can then use the type in your code by passing it as generic of the `mcplug` function.

```ts
const tools = await mcplug<MCPLUG_YOUR_PLUG_NAME>({
  token: PLUG_TOKEN,
  id: PLUG_ID
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What is the weather in Paris?"
    }
  ],
  // Necessary to let the LLM use the tools in a loop if needed and generate a response
  maxSteps: 10,
  tools
});
```

After that, the `toolCalls` or `toolResults` properties of the `result` will be typed and you will be able to use them safely in your code.

### Specifying the folder

You can specify the folder of the generated types by using the `--folder` flag.

```bash
npx mcplug types <PLUG_ID> --output src/types
```
