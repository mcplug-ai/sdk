<Info>
  The sdk will use the session-id passed by the MCP client to instantiate the Durable Object. This will allow you to
  securely store context between requests if needed.

(We are working on a way to give you the ability to generate a custom id for the Durable Object thought)

</Info>

To get started with MCPlug, you can use the `mcplug init` command to create a new project and choose the Cloudflare Durable Object template.

```bash
npx mcplug init <project-name>
```

This command will create a new project with the Cloudflare Durable Object template and install the necessary dependencies.

It will also create a MCP_SECRET that will be used to authenticate requests from our proxy to your server.

<Info>
  The main difference with the worker template is that your index.ts will export the durable object class alongside the
  main handler and that the versions defined in createWorkerMcp function is not an object but the name of the durable
  object class.
</Info>

## Example

```ts
import { tool, createWorkerMcp, createDurableMcp } from "@mcplug/server/cloudflare";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
import { z } from "zod";

export class MyDurableMcp extends createDurableMcp({
  name: "MyDurableMcp"
}) {
  tools = {
    "get-weather": tool("Use this tool to get the weather in a given city")
      .input(
        z.object({
          city: z.string()
        })
      )
      .handle(async ({ input }) => {
        return {
          city: input.city,
          temp: 20,
          unit: "C",
          condition: "sunny"
        };
      })
  };
}

export default createWorkerMcp({
  secret: env.MCP_SECRET,
  versions: {
    "1.0.0": "MyDurableMcp"
  }
});
```

## Deploying the server

To deploy the server you can create a github or gitlab repository and use the cloudflare integration to deploy the server.
