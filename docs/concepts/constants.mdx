When depoloying your mcp server, you may need the developper who is using your mcp server to give you some constants or secrets. It can be API_KEY for your service or authentication tokens.

This constants are not something the LLM will be able to access or use in the prompt. It is the responsibility of the developer to give you the constants.

For example if I develop a mcp server that is a weather service, the developer will need to give me the API_KEY for the weather service and the LLM will need need to give me the city name.

## Define a constant

To define a constant that your tool will access, you have to prefixed a property with an underscore `_` in your input schema.

```ts
import { tool } from "@mcplug/server";

export const myTool = tool(
  "This is the description of the tool. It is highly recommended to provide a detailed description of the tool."
).input(
  z
    .object({
      _WEATHER_API_KEY: z.string().describe("The API key for the weather service"),
      city: z.string().describe("The city name")
    })
    .handle(async ({ input }) => {
      const { _WEATHER_API_KEY, city } = input;

      const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${_WEATHER_API_KEY}`
      );
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    })
);
```

In this example, the `_WEATHER_API_KEY` is a constant that will be provided by the developer and the `city` is the city name that the LLM will provide.

## How constants are passed to the tool

To use a constant in your tool, you can destructure the constant from the input object.

```ts
import { mcplug } from "@mcplug/client";

const tools = await mcplug(MCPLUG_TOKEN, {
  id: "plug_id",
  constants: {
    _WEATHER_API_KEY: "1234567890"
  }
});
// ... rest of the code
```
