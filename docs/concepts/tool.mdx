As per the MCP specification:

<Info>

Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server

Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.

# Define a tool

```ts
import { tool } from "@mcplug/server";

export const myTool = tool(
  "This is the description of the tool. It is highly recommended to provide a detailed description of the tool. In order for the llm to understand how and when to use the tool."
)
  .input(
    z.object({
      name: z.string().describe("The name of the person"),
      age: z.number().describe("The age of the person")
    })
  )
  .output(
    z.object({
      name: z.string().describe("The name of the person"),
      age: z.number().describe("The age of the person")
    })
  )
  .handle(async ({ input, userId, sessionId, error }) => {
    try {
      const result = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({ input, userId, sessionId })
      });

      return {
        name: result.name,
        age: result.age
      };
    } catch (error) {
      // You can return an error to the llm to handle it. This will built a standard RPC error.
      return error("An error occurred while executing the tool.");
    }
  });
```

## Input and output schema

You can define an input and output schema for your tool using `zod`, `valibot` or `arktype`.

Output schema is not mandatory but highly recommended. It will be used to generate the types for the tool in order to provide a better developer experience when using your mcp server.

## Handle

The `handle` function is the main function of the tool. It is the function that will be called when the tool is executed.

It will receive the input, an error function, the userId and the sessionId as arguments.

You can return an error to the llm to handle it. This will built a standard RPC error.

SessionId is the id of the session that is currently being executed. It can be used to identify the session and to store data associated with it.

UserId is the id of the user that is currently executing the tool, it is not mandatory to provide it. But can give you more context about the user.

<Note>
The handle function can return either a string or an object. You DO NOT NEED to return an object that follows the mcp specification. This is handled under the hood by the SDK.
