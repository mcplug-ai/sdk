## What is Mcplug?

Mcplug is a an open registry of mcp servers that simplifies their discovery and use inside the code of your application.

We provide a server sdk that streamlines the process of creating and versionning a MCP server.

The sdk is using the latest [Streamable HTTP specification of 20025-03-06](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/).

Although the sdk is made for developers to publish their own MCP servers on Mcplug.ai it can be used to deploy standards MCP servers elsewhere.

## Simple example

Here is a simple example of how to use the mcplug sdk to create a MCP server on cloudflare workers.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { tool, createHandler } from "@mcplug/server/cloudflare";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default createHandler({
  secret: env.MCP_SECRET,
  versions: {
    "1.0.0": {
      name: "Weather_Mcp",
      tools: {
        "get-weather": tool("Use this tool to get the weather in a given city")
          .input(
            z.object({
              city: z.string()
            })
          )
          .handle(async ({ input }) => {
            return {
              city: input.city,
              temp: 20,
              unit: "C",
              condition: "sunny"
            };
          })
      }
    }
  }
});
```

At is core a server is just an object of versions.

Each version has a name and records of tools / prompts / ressources.
