## Server informations

Similar to a npm we rely on the package.json file to gather information about your MCP server.

This are the fields you need to fill:

- `name`: The name of your MCP server.
- `description`: A description of your MCP server.
- `version`: The version of your MCP server. It must be a valid semver version.
  {/* - `license`: The license of your MCP server. */}
- `repository.url`: The url of the repository of your MCP server if you have one.
- `homepage`: The url of the homepage of your service if you have one.

## Readme and changelog

We also rely on a README.md file to generate the documentation of your MCP server and a version changelog found inside the changelogs folder.

The README will be used on the main page of your MCP server and the changelog will be used to generate the changelog of your MCP server.

One using the dev command, the changelog will be generated automatically based on the version number you are currently on.

## Defining outout

We have made the choice to make output mandatory for tools. This will improve the developer experience when using your MCP server.

Make sure every tool has an output schema otherwise it will be rejected.
