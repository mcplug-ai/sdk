Once you have prepared your MCP server, you can publish it to the MCP registry.

To publish your MCP server, you need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run publish
```

This will launch a build process, bundling your MCP server into a single Cloudflare Worker file.

Your MCP server will be deployed and made available on the MCPlug registry and everyone will be able to use it in their code.

<Warning>
  Every MCP server will pass an audit process to ensure it is secure and does not contain any malicious code.

If your
MCP server does not pass the audit process, you can choose to publish and it will be exposed as unsafe. Or you can check the audit file and fix the issues before choosing to publish.

If you find the audit process too strict, please let us know and we will see what we can do.

</Warning>

## Publish a new version

To publish a new version of your MCP server, you just need to increment the version number in the package.json file and run the publish command again.

If you want to, make sure you have a changelog for the new version.
